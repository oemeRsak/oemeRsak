# ðŸ’« About Me:
Ever since I was young, I've been really interested in computers. I started learning the basics of programming when I was in primary school and began working on Arduino projects when I was in secondary school. Later, I learned Python and have been working to get better at it. Now I have a strong interest in Backend Developing and Infotronics. Currently I'm learning few things like Django, Golang, Lua and sometimes enjoy designing and printing simple 3D models as a hobby.

There is always something to Learn.
