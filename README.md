# ðŸ’« About Me:

I was born in **Turkey** ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·, and I currently live in **Germany** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. Ever since I was young, I've been really interested in **computers**. I started learning the basics of **programming** when I was in primary school and began working on **Arduino** projects when I was in secondary school. Later, I  in **Python** and have been working to get better at it. Now I have a strong interest in **Backend Developing** and **Penetration Testing**.
