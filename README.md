# 💫 About Me:
I was born in Turkey and I live in Germany. Ever since I was young, I've been really interested in computers. I started learning the basics of programming when I was in primary school and began working on Arduino projects when I was in secondary school. Later, I learned Python and have been working to get better at it. Now I have a strong interest in backend development and infotronics. Currently I'm learning a few things, such as Django, and sometimes enjoy designing and printing simple 3D models as a hobby.

My ultimate goal is to continuously advance my knowledge. There is always something to learn.
